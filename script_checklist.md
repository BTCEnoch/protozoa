### **Script Development Guidelines**

#### **Required Script Structure**
```powershell
# XX-ScriptName.ps1
# Description and phase reference
#Requires -Version 5.1

[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
    [string]$ProjectRoot = (Split-Path $PSScriptRoot -Parent)
)

try {
    Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\utils.psm1" -Force -ErrorAction Stop
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to import utilities module: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit 1
}

$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

try {
    Write-StepHeader "Script Description - Phase X"
    
    # Implementation logic here
    
    Write-SuccessLog "Script completed successfully"
    exit 0
}
catch {
    Write-ErrorLog "Script failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit 1
}
finally {
    try { Pop-Location -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } catch { }
}
```

#### **Code Generation Standards**
- All generated services MUST use singleton pattern with `static #instance`
- All services MUST implement dispose() method for resource cleanup  
- All services MUST include comprehensive JSDoc3 documentation
- All services MUST use Winston logging with `createServiceLogger()`
- All generated code MUST follow .cursorrules architectural standards
