# MVP – Bitcoin‑Seeded Digital Organisms

Protozoa generates and evolves digital organisms using Bitcoin Ordinals. Each organism is deterministically seeded from Bitcoin block data so that its traits are permanently tied to blockchain history. The system includes:

- **Trait Generation** – Traits are derived from block header data and ordinals inscriptions.
- **Physics Engine** – Custom physics governs particle behavior and group formations.
- **Visualization** – Three.js renders organisms in real‑time with React integration.
- **On‑chain Storage** – Organism state hashes are inscribed via the Ordinals protocol.

The goal is to provide a reproducible simulation where every Bitcoin block can produce a unique organism lineage.
