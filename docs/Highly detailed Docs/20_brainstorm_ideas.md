# Brainstorm Ideas

This document serves as a collection of ideas and concepts that could be implemented in future iterations of the Beast Import project. These ideas are not part of the current implementation plan but are recorded here for future consideration.

## Birth Traits

### Concept
Birth traits would be special characteristics assigned to particle creatures at their creation (0 confirmations), providing unique starting points before any mutations occur.

### Implementation Ideas

### Potential Birth Traits
1. **Core Formation**: Special core particle arrangement
