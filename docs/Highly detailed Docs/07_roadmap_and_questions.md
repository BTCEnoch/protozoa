## Open Questions and Considerations

### Technical Questions
1. **Bitcoin Block Data**: How should we handle potential API limitations or failures when fetching block data from ordinals.com?
2. **Web Rendering Performance**: What optimizations are needed to ensure smooth rendering of 500 particles per creature in web browsers?
3. **Memory Optimization**: What are the specific memory usage patterns we expect, and how should we optimize for them?
4. **Worker Distribution**: How should we balance work between main thread and web workers?
5. **Force Field Complexity**: What is the optimal number and complexity of force fields to balance visual interest and performance?

### Design Questions
1. **Role Balance**: What is the optimal distribution of the five particle roles (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK)?
2. **Visual Design**: What additional visual effects would enhance the particle ecosystem while maintaining performance?
3. **Development UI**: What specific controls and visualizations are most important for the development UI?
4. **Force Field Visualization**: How should we visualize the different force fields to make their roles clear?
5. **Creature Differentiation**: How can we ensure each Bitcoin block produces a visually distinct and interesting creature?

### Bitcoin Integration Questions
1. **Inscription Size**: How can we minimize the size of our code for Bitcoin inscription while maintaining functionality?
2. **Dependency Management**: What is the optimal strategy for loading and managing on-chain dependencies?
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: What fallbacks should we implement if certain inscribed resources are slow to load?
4. **Testing Strategy**: How can we effectively test the application as it would run from Bitcoin inscriptions?
5. **Versioning Strategy**: Since the code will be immutable once inscribed, how should we approach the final version?

## Next Steps
1. Finalize the core architecture design
2. Create detailed technical specifications for each component
3. Develop proof-of-concept implementations for critical components
4. Establish development environment and toolchain
5. Begin implementation of foundation components
