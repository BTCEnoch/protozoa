## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Inscription Health Checks

Implement health checks to verify inscriptions are accessible:

```javascript
async function checkInscriptionHealth(inscriptionIds) {
  const results = {};
  
  for (const id of inscriptionIds) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/content/${id}`);
      results[id] = response.ok;
    } catch (err) {
      results[id] = false;
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

### Update Strategy

For future updates, new inscriptions will be created and the main HTML inscription updated:

1. Inscribe new versions of changed chunks
2. Create a new main HTML inscription with updated references
3. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Security Considerations

### Content Security

- Use subresource integrity checks where possible
- Implement content verification before execution
- Validate loaded scripts match expected signatures

### Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling for failed loads
- Provide clear user feedback for loading issues
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Bitcoin, complete this checklist:

1. **Build Verification**
   - [ ] All chunks build successfully
   - [ ] Bundle size is optimized
   - [ ] No unnecessary code or dependencies

2. **Local Testing**
   - [ ] Application works in local environment
   - [ ] All features function correctly
   - [ ] Performance meets requirements

3. **Inscription Preparation**
   - [ ] Chunks are properly split
   - [ ] Dependencies are identified
   - [ ] Loading order is defined

4. **Wallet Preparation**
   - [ ] Wallet has sufficient funds
   - [ ] Private keys are secured
   - [ ] Fee rates are appropriate

5. **Backup**
   - [ ] All source code is backed up
   - [ ] Build artifacts are backed up
   - [ ] Inscription IDs are recorded

6. **Post-Deployment**
   - [ ] Verify all inscriptions are accessible
   - [ ] Test application functionality
   - [ ] Monitor for any issues

## Deployment Timeline

A typical deployment timeline looks like this:

1. **Day 1**: Build and optimize application
2. **Day 2**: Prepare chunks and test locally
3. **Day 3**: Inscribe dependencies and core chunks
4. **Day 4**: Inscribe remaining chunks and main HTML
5. **Day 5**: Verify and test inscriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Inscription Not Found**
   - Check inscription ID is correct
   - Verify transaction was confirmed
   - Try accessing through different Ordinals explorers

2. **Loading Failures**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all dependencies are loaded in correct order
   - Test fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check chunk sizes
   - Verify loading sequence
   - Monitor network requests

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Failed Inscription**
   - Record failed inscription details
   - Retry inscription with higher fee rate
   - Update references if new inscription ID is created

2. **Corrupted Data**
   - Verify source data integrity
   - Re-inscribe from verified source
   - Update references to new inscription

## Conclusion

This deployment pipeline provides a structured approach to inscribing the Beast Import project on Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol. By carefully planning the inscription process, implementing fallback mechanisms, and monitoring inscription health, we can ensure a reliable and performant user experience.

The pipeline is designed to be flexible and can be adapted as the Ordinals ecosystem evolves. Regular testing and verification throughout the process will help identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

By following this pipeline, we can successfully deploy the Beast Import project as a collection of inscriptions on Bitcoin, creating a unique and immutable digital artifact that leverages the security and permanence of the Bitcoin blockchain.
