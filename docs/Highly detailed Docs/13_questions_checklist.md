## Bitcoin Integration Questions

- [x] **Inscription Process**: Manual inscription with packaging of modules as exports with inscription IDs
- [x] **Dependency Loading**: Load via script src tags with appropriate sequencing

- [x] **Loading Experience**: Loading screen followed by simulation in action
- [x] **Interaction Model**: Initially observation only (like an aquarium), with possible interactions later
- [x] **Data Display**: Stats for creature and particle groups, trait listings, data overlays
- [x] **Accessibility Considerations**: Keep open for all users, prepare for future accessibility protocols
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Auto-adjust to common screen resolution ratios
- [x] **Visual Styling**: Sleek UI with dark grey and Bitcoin orange color scheme
- [x] **Error Messaging**: Focus on error prevention with immutable resources
- [ ] **Performance Degradation**: To be addressed during detailed optimization work

## Evolution Mechanics Questions

- [x] **Confirmation-Based Evolution**: Use milestone-based mutation system with confirmation thresholds
- [x] **Visual Transformation**: Add visual effects specific to each mutation type
- [x] **Trait Modification**: Apply attribute boosts, type changes, count increases, and group splits
- [x] **Evolution Triggers**: Use specific confirmation milestones (10k, 50k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 1M)
- [x] **Mutation Chance**: Roll for mutation chance at each milestone with rarity-based selection

## Attribute and Trait Questions

- [x] **Group Attributes**: Core attributes include perception, force field shapes, color, visual effects, scale, particle shape, and force values
- [x] **Attribute Ranges**: Attributes typically range from 0-1, with rarity affecting the range (common: 0.1-0.3, mythic: 0.9-1.0)
- [x] **Trait Categories**: Categories include visual traits, formation traits, behavior traits, and force calculation traits
- [x] **Visual Traits**: Visual traits include particle shape, color, effects (trails, glow, etc.), organized by rarity tiers
- [x] **Trait Interactions**: Role-based interactions with specific attraction/repulsion values between different group types
- [x] **Formation Traits**: Role-specific formations (e.g., sphere, toroid for defense) organized by rarity tiers
- [x] **Behavior Traits**: Emergent behaviors organized by rarity tiers with role-specific variations

## Trait System Details
