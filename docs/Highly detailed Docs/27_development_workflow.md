# Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for the Bitcoin Protozoa project, focusing on building the engine first before preparing for inscription on Bitcoin. The workflow is designed to ensure a smooth development process while keeping the final inscription requirements in mind.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Engine Development

The primary focus is on building a fully functional particle simulation engine that meets all the requirements:

1. **Core Engine Components**
   - Particle system
   - Physics engine
   - Force field system
   - Formation calculations
   - RNG system
   - Trait system

2. **Development Environment**
   - Use Vite for fast development and hot module replacement
   - Implement TypeScript for type safety
   - Set up React and React Three Fiber for rendering
   - Configure Zustand for state management

3. **Development Dependencies**
   - During development, use npm/yarn to install all required dependencies
   - Keep track of all dependencies that will need to be inscribed later
   - Use standard development tools without inscription constraints

4. **Testing Environment**
   - Implement browser-based testing
   - Set up Vitest for unit testing
   - Create visual regression tests for particle behaviors
   - Test performance on various devices

### Phase 2: Optimization

Once the engine is functional, focus on optimization:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement all performance strategies from the optimization document
   - Profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize render loops and physics calculations
   - Implement worker-based processing

2. **Code Size Optimization**
   - Analyze bundle size
   - Remove unused code
   - Implement code splitting strategy
   - Minimize dependencies

3. **Memory Optimization**
   - Implement object pooling
   - Optimize data structures
   - Reduce garbage collection pressure
   - Monitor memory usage

### Phase 3: Inscription Preparation

Prepare the codebase for inscription on Bitcoin:

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Identify all external dependencies
   - Determine which dependencies need to be inscribed
   - Create a dependency loading strategy
   - Test with simulated inscription environment

2. **Code Splitting for Inscription**
   - Implement the code splitting strategy for inscriptions
   - Create optimal chunk sizes for inscription
   - Define loading order for dependencies
   - Test loading sequence

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Implement fallbacks for failed inscriptions
   - Create retry mechanisms for loading dependencies
   - Add error handling for missing resources
   - Test resilience to network issues

### Phase 4: Deployment and Testing

Final preparation for deployment:

1. **Inscription Testing**
   - Test with actual inscriptions on testnet
   - Verify loading sequence works
   - Confirm all dependencies load correctly
   - Validate performance in real-world conditions

2. **Final Optimization**
   - Make final adjustments based on inscription testing
   - Optimize loading sequence
   - Minimize initial load time
   - Ensure smooth user experience

## Development Tools and Practices

### Version Control

- Use Git for version control
- Implement feature branches for development
- Use pull requests for code review
- Maintain a clean commit history

### Code Quality

- Implement ESLint for code quality
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Document code thoroughly

### Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Implement integration tests for system components
- Create visual tests for particle behaviors
- Perform performance testing regularly

### Documentation

- Document all components and systems
- Create architecture diagrams
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- Document optimization strategies

## Bitcoin Dependencies During Development

During development, we will handle Bitcoin dependencies as follows:

1. **Local Development**
   - Use mock Bitcoin data for local development
   - Create test fixtures for block data
   - Simulate confirmation counts
   - Generate test nonces for deterministic testing

2. **API Integration**
   - Use ordinals.com API for real Bitcoin data
   - Implement caching for API responses
   - Add fallback mechanisms for API failures
   - Create test environments with API mocks

3. **Inscription Testing**
   - Test with small inscriptions first
   - Gradually increase inscription complexity
   - Test loading sequence with actual inscriptions
   - Validate behavior with real Bitcoin data

## Development Environment Setup

### Local Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/beast-import.git
cd beast-import

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Required Tools

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Modern web browser with developer tools
- Code editor with TypeScript support

### Recommended Extensions

- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript
- React Developer Tools
- Three.js Editor

## Development Workflow Steps

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create a feature branch
   - Implement the feature
   - Write tests
   - Document the feature
   - Create a pull request

2. **Code Review**
   - Review code for quality and performance
   - Verify tests pass
   - Check documentation
   - Approve or request changes

3. **Integration**
   - Merge feature branch
   - Verify integration tests pass
   - Check for performance regressions
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Release Preparation**
   - Create a release branch
   - Perform final testing
   - Prepare for inscription
   - Create release notes

## Inscription Workflow

The inscription workflow will be detailed in the deployment pipeline document, but the key steps are:

1. Build optimized production code
2. Split code into inscription chunks
3. Inscribe dependencies in correct order
4. Inscribe application code
5. Test inscribed application
6. Deploy final inscriptions

## Conclusion

This development workflow focuses on building a solid engine first, then preparing it for inscription on Bitcoin. By following this approach, we can ensure that the application functions correctly and performs well before dealing with the complexities of inscription. The workflow is designed to be flexible and iterative, allowing for adjustments as needed during development.
