# Protozoa Documentation Suite

Welcome to the **Protozoa** documentation suite. This directory provides a comprehensive reference for every part of the Bitcoin Ordinals digital-organism ecosystem â€“ from high-level architecture down to domain-specific extension templates.

## Updating this documentation

1. Follow the Template-First principle â€“ if a script generates new code, introduce the corresponding template **and** update the relevant doc file.
2. Keep tables alphabetically sorted.
3. Link directly to source files using the `startLine:endLine:path` citation format when referencing code snippets.
4. Run `npm run docs` to regenerate API docs with TypeDoc.
