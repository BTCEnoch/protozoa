You are an EXPERT software developer

Write concise, efficient code. ALWAYS COMMENT YOUR CODE. NEVER ERASE OLD COMMENTS IF THEY ARE STILL USEFUL

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
COMMENTING:
Use clear and concise language
Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don't just restate what the code does)
Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
Use single-line comments for brief explanations
Use multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class descriptions
Ensure comments are JSDoc3 styled
LOGGING
We use WINSTON for logging. We should have a Winston logging modular file that we reference
Log EVERY logical connection and workflow of the codebase
Ensure a variety of the different logging levels depending on the workflow and logic
Your output should be the original code with your added comments. Make sure to preserve the original code's formatting and structure.

ARCHITECTURE & PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS

Classes vs Functional Programming - Use the Right Tool for the Job:

CLASSES ARE PREFERRED AND SOLID IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR:
  - Complex Service Layer: Classes excel for services with complex state management (RenderingService, RNGService, PhysicsService, BitcoinService, etc.)
  - Singleton Patterns: Services that need single instances across the application - classes provide natural singleton implementation
  - Resource Management: THREE.js objects, WebGL resources, caching systems - classes offer superior lifecycle management
  - Performance-Critical Services: Where object reuse and state persistence matter - classes optimize memory allocation
  - Interface Implementation: Services implementing dependency injection contracts - classes provide clear contract definitions
  - Legacy Integration: When working with class-based libraries (THREE.js, etc.) - classes maintain API consistency
  - State-Heavy Operations: Bitcoin blockchain interactions, physics simulations, particle systems - classes encapsulate complexity effectively
  - Service Orchestration: Coordinating multiple subsystems and maintaining service state - classes provide natural organization

PREFER FUNCTIONAL FOR:
  - React Components: Always use functional components with hooks
  - Utilities & Helpers: Pure functions for calculations, transformations, validations
  - Business Logic: Domain logic that doesn't require complex state
  - Simple State Management: Use functional approaches with closures for simple state
  - API Calls: Use functional approaches for HTTP requests and data fetching (unless part of a larger service class)

## ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY ENFORCEMENT

### Domain Boundary Rules - CRITICAL FOR CODEBASE HEALTH
- NEVER create functionality outside designated domain boundaries
- Each domain MUST have single responsibility: 
  - /rng/ = ALL random number generation (NO exceptions)
  - /physics/ = ALL particle physics calculations (NO lib/utils physics)
  - /particle/ = ALL particle type definitions and operations
  - /bitcoin/ = ALL blockchain interactions
  - /rendering/ = ALL THREE.js and visual rendering
  - /animation/ = ALL particle movement and effects
  - /formation/ = ALL particle formation patterns
  - /trait/ = ALL organism trait management
- Cross-domain communication MUST use defined interfaces only
- NEVER duplicate domain functionality in shared/ or lib/ directories
- Before creating ANY utility, CHECK if domain service exists first

### Service Architecture Standards - CLASS-BASED EXCELLENCE
- Complex services MUST use class-based architecture with singleton pattern
- Service naming convention: DomainNameService (e.g., RNGService, PhysicsService)
- All services MUST implement IServiceName interface for dependency injection
- All services MUST have getInstance() factory function for singleton access
- Private members MUST use # syntax for true encapsulation
- All public methods MUST have comprehensive JSDoc3 documentation
- Resource cleanup MUST be implemented in dispose() method
- Services MUST include Winston logging throughout all methods
- Error handling MUST be centralized at the class level
- Method chaining SHOULD be used where appropriate for fluent interfaces

## DUPLICATION PREVENTION - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

### Algorithm & Function Standards
- ONE canonical implementation per algorithm (e.g., ONE Mulberry32 RNG implementation in RNGService ONLY)
- NO duplicate physics calculations across domains/utilities
- NO duplicate type definitions (use shared interfaces with proper imports)
- Before implementing ANY function, search codebase for existing implementation
- ALL utility functions MUST be consolidated into appropriate domain services
- NO shared utilities that duplicate domain-specific functionality

### State Management Standards
- ONE Zustand store per domain (NO conflicting exports)
- Store naming: useDomainNameStore (e.g., useSimulationStore, useParticleStore)
- NO duplicate store exports from different files
- State interfaces MUST be centralized in domain types directory
- Cross-store communication MUST use defined messaging patterns

### Type Definition Standards  
- Master type definitions in domain/types/ directories
- NO basic types in shared/ if enhanced version exists in domain
- Interface naming: IDomainName for service contracts, DomainName for data types
- ALL types MUST be properly exported and imported (NO redefinition)
- Generic types MUST be defined once and reused across domains

## FILE ORGANIZATION & NAMING ENFORCEMENT

### Prohibited Patterns - IMMEDIATE REMOVAL REQUIRED
- NO test files in production directories (test.js, test.ts, test-*.* files)
- NO backup files (.bak, .backup, .old extensions)
- NO PowerShell scripts in domain directories (.ps1 files)
- NO debug/temp files (temp-*, debug-*, scratch-* files)
- NO duplicate component files with similar names
- NO empty or placeholder files without implementation

### Directory Structure Standards
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Domain directories MUST follow pattern: /domains/domain-name/
- Each domain MUST have: /services/, /types/, /utils/, /interfaces/
- Shared utilities ONLY for cross-domain, non-business logic functions
- Components directory for React components ONLY (NO services)

### File Naming Conventions
- Services: domainNameService.ts (camelCase with Service suffix)
- Interfaces: IDomainName.ts (PascalCase with I prefix)
- Types: domainName.types.ts (camelCase with .types suffix)
- Components: ComponentName.tsx (PascalCase)
- Utilities: utilityName.utils.ts (camelCase with .utils suffix)
- Stores: domainName.store.ts (camelCase with .store suffix)

## IMPORT/EXPORT STANDARDS & DEPENDENCY FLOW

### Import Path Rules
- Domain imports MUST use: @/domains/domain-name/
- Shared imports MUST use: @/shared/
- Component imports MUST use: @/components/
- NO relative imports across domain boundaries (../../../)
- NO legacy lib/ imports if domain equivalent exists
- ALL imports MUST be explicit (NO barrel exports without documentation)

### Dependency Flow Requirements
- Services can depend on other services through constructor injection
- Components can depend on services through singleton access
- Utilities can depend on services but NOT vice versa
- Domains can communicate through interfaces ONLY
- NO circular dependencies between domains
- NO shared/ importing from domains/ (one-way dependency flow)

### Export Standards
- Named exports for all components, services, and utilities
- Default exports ONLY for React components
- Service exports: export { DomainNameService }
- Interface exports: export { type IDomainName }
- Store exports: export { useDomainNameStore }

Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate React examples.
  - Choose paradigm based on complexity and requirements, not dogma.
  - Classes are a SOLID architectural choice for complex services - embrace them when appropriate.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
  
JavaScript
  - Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
  - Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
  - File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
  - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
  - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).
  
Error Handling and Validation
    - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
  
React
  - Use functional components and interfaces.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  - Use function, not const, for components.
  - Use Next UI, and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
  - Implement responsive design.
  - Place static content and interfaces at file end.
  - Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
  - Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
  - Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
  - Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
  - Always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.

Service Layer Guidelines - Classes Are The Preferred Architecture
  - Use classes for complex services (RenderingService, RNGService, GroupService, PhysicsService, BitcoinService, etc.) - they provide superior organization
  - Implement singleton pattern for application-wide services - classes excel at maintaining single instances
  - Use interfaces for dependency injection and testing - classes naturally implement contracts
  - Proper encapsulation with private members - classes provide excellent data hiding and access control
  - Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public methods - document the class API thoroughly
  - Winston logging throughout service methods - maintain observability in class operations
  - Resource cleanup in disposal methods - classes provide clear lifecycle management
  - State management through private properties - classes encapsulate state effectively
  - Method chaining where appropriate - classes can provide fluent interfaces
  - Error handling at the class level - centralized error management within service boundaries
  - Class-based dependency injection - services can depend on other services through constructor injection
